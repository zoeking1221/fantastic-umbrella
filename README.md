# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

This code provides the back-end for an e-commerce website. It allows the user to enter their MySQL credentials to connect to a database using Sequelize, seed the database with test data, and perform POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in a test application (such as Insomnia Core) to create, update, and delete data in the database.

A demo of how to use this application and view functionality can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19QVGwiXASidB50a07A9GptpYKCVdu4LD/view
